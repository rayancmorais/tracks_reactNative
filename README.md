## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** or **yarn**
* **Expo Go** app installed on your mobile device (or a working emulator/simulator)
* **Ngrok** CLI installed and an account for exposing your local backend server.

### 1. Clone the Repositories

This project requires both the client and its server. Assuming the server code is in a dedicated folder (e.g., `tracks-server`).

```bash
# Clone the client (this repository)
git clone [https://github.com/rayancmorais/tracks_reactNative.git](https://github.com/rayancmorais/tracks_reactNative.git)
cd tracks_reactNative

# Install client dependencies
npm install # or yarn install
